#DojoQuest
=========

`V. Dagoury, 2014-06-07`

## Presentation
Project upon which I've put the aim of exploring dojo toolkit (1.9) capabilities with specific goals :

* using the MVC pattern for a full CRUD SPA
* data binding
* views manipulation.

**notice** : the src directory must integrate dojo toolkit distribution (i.e. sub directories dojo, dijit and dojox) in order to work



 It is based on many resources found [here](http://jamesthom.as/blog/2012/02/26/dojomvc-models) on the Web.
